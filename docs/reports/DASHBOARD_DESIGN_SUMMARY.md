# Dashboard Design Summary - Quick Reference

**For:** JJF Survey Analytics - Organization Participation Dashboard
**Database:** `simple_data.db`
**Date:** 2025-10-11

---

## Key Insights at a Glance

### Current Status
- **24 organizations** completed intake
- **3 organizations (12.5%)** completed CEO survey
- **1 organization (4.2%)** fully complete (Hadar Institute)
- **21 organizations (87.5%)** awaiting CEO survey

### Critical Bottleneck
**87.5% drop-off between Intake and CEO Survey** - This is the primary area needing attention.

---

## Organization Linkage (How to Connect Data)

Organizations are linked across tabs by **exact name matching**:

```
Intake tab:     json_extract(data_json, '$.\"Organization Name:\"')
CEO tab:        json_extract(data_json, '$.\"CEO Organization\"')
Tech tab:       json_extract(data_json, '$.Organization')
Staff tab:      json_extract(data_json, '$.Organization')
```

**Example:**
```
"Hadar Institute" in Intake
  ‚Üí matches "Hadar Institute" in CEO
    ‚Üí matches "Hadar Institute" in Tech
      ‚Üí matches "Hadar Institute" in Staff
```

1-3 months        7 orgs ‚Üí 1 CEO done (14.3% completion)
3-6 months        3 orgs ‚Üí 0 CEO done (0% completion)
6-9 months        1 org  ‚Üí 0 CEO done (0% completion)
Don't know        2 orgs ‚Üí 0 CEO done (0% completion)
```

## Data Quality Issues Found

### 1. Duplicate Intakes (4 organizations)
- **JIMENA:** Sarah Levin + Nathaniel Malka
- **Jewtina:** Analucia Lopezrevoredo + Violeta Stolpen
- **R&R:** Rachel Zieleniec + Sokeng
- **UpStart:** Aaron Katler + Seth Linden

**Dashboard Solution:** Show most recent intake or list both contacts

### 2. Self-Assigned Tech Leads
- **R&R:** CEO Josh Feldman assigned himself as tech lead but hasn't completed tech survey

**Dashboard Solution:** Flag "self-assigned delegates" separately

### 3. Assigned Delegates Not Responding
- **Jewish New Teacher Project:** 2 staff assigned (Lauren Katz, Leah Volynsky), 0 responses

**Dashboard Solution:** Show "delegates assigned but not responding" status with days since assignment

## Sample Queries (Simplified)

### Get All Organizations with Status
```sql
WITH intake AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        TRIM(json_extract(data_json, '$.\"Organization Name:\"')) as org,
        json_extract(data_json, '$.Date') as date
    FROM tab_data WHERE tab_name = 'Intake'
),
ceo AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(json_extract(data_json, '$.\"CEO Organization\"')) as org
    FROM tab_data WHERE tab_name = 'CEO'
)
SELECT
    i.org,
    i.date,
    CASE WHEN c.org IS NOT NULL THEN 'Complete' ELSE 'Pending' END as ceo_status
FROM intake i
LEFT JOIN ceo c ON i.org = c.org;
```

### Get Summary Metrics
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN tab_name = 'Intake'
        THEN TRIM(json_extract(data_json, '$.\"Organization Name:\"')) END) as total,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN tab_name = 'CEO'
        THEN TRIM(json_extract(data_json, '$.\"CEO Organization\"')) END) as ceo_done
FROM tab_data;
```
