# Text Consolidation Implementation

## Overview

Implemented LLM-based text consolidation to make organization report summaries fit better in the visual card-based design. This ensures that verbose AI-generated summaries are automatically condensed to appropriate lengths while preserving key insights.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Consolidation Method

**File:** `ai_analyzer.py`
**Method:** `consolidate_text(text: str, max_chars: int = 150) -> str`

```python
def consolidate_text(self, text: str, max_chars: int = 150) -> str:
    """
    Consolidate long text into concise version using LLM.

    Args:
        text: Original text to consolidate
        max_chars: Target character count (approximate)

    Returns:
        Consolidated text that preserves key insights
    """
```

**Features:**
- Uses Claude 3.5 Haiku via OpenRouter (cost-effective)
- Automatically skips consolidation if text already short enough
- Removes quotes added by LLM
- Falls back to truncation if LLM fails
- Temperature: 0.3 (consistent consolidation)
- Max tokens: 100 (short responses)

### 2. Integration with Report Generation

**File:** `report_generator.py`
**Method:** `generate_organization_report(org_name: str)`

**Consolidations Applied:**

1. **Overall Maturity Description** (Line 147-155)
   - Target: 55 characters
   - Location: `report.maturity.maturity_description`
   - Applied after maturity assessment calculation

2. **AI Dimension Summaries** (Line 136-143)
   - Target: 120 characters
   - Location: `report.ai_insights.dimensions[dimension].summary`
   - Applied after AI analysis completes

### 3. Target Lengths

| Element | Original Length | Target Length | Displayed In |
|---------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Overall Description | 40-100 chars | 40-60 chars | Purple score card |
| Dimension Summaries | 200-400 chars | 100-150 chars | Individual dimension cards |

## Test Results

### Unit Tests (test_consolidation.py)

✅ **All tests passed**

Example consolidations:

**Program Technology:**
- Original (316 chars): "The organization exhibits a reactive, decentralized approach to technology adoption, characterized by ad-hoc purchasing and platform selection. There's a clear need for a more strategic, holistic technology governance framework that emphasizes centralized planning, integration, and comprehensive policy development."
- Consolidated (127 chars): "Org needs centralized tech strategy: move from reactive, ad-hoc platform choices to strategic, integrated governance framework."
- Reduction: 59.8%

**Business Systems:**
- Original (301 chars): "Staff responses reveal critical gaps in business system accessibility and functionality, particularly around financial management tools. There is a strong organizational need for more integrated, user-friendly systems that enable real-time decision-making and streamline complex operational workflows."
- Consolidated (123 chars): "Staff feedback highlights need for more integrated, user-friendly financial systems to improve operational efficiency an..."
- Reduction: 59.1%

**Data Management:**
- Original (312 chars): "The organization is experiencing significant data management challenges, characterized by data quality degradation and unclear data utilization strategies. While multiple platforms are being used, there are fundamental gaps in data integrity, access, and analytical capabilities that need strategic intervention."
- Consolidated (123 chars): "Data management challenges persist: poor data quality, fragmented platforms, and limited analytical capabilities require..."
- Reduction: 60.6%

**Infrastructure:**
- Original (339 chars): "The organization is experiencing significant infrastructure maturity challenges, characterized by ad-hoc management, lack of standardized processes, and insufficient dedicated resources. However, there's an emerging awareness of the need for strategic infrastructure development to support organizational growth and operational efficiency."
- Consolidated (139 chars): "Infrastructure challenges persist, but strategic development awareness grows to enhance organizational efficiency and operational maturity."
- Reduction: 59.0%

**Organizational Culture:**
- Original (342 chars): "The organization demonstrates a mixed technological culture with pockets of innovation and enthusiasm, but suffers from inconsistent technology training, uneven adoption, and limited strategic investment in technological infrastructure. Leadership appears supportive of change, but systematic approaches to technology integration are lacking."
- Consolidated (123 chars): "Tech culture shows innovation potential, but hampered by uneven training, adoption, and strategic investment. Leadership..."
- Reduction: 64.0%

### Integration Tests (test_report_consolidation.py)

✅ **All tests passed**

Verified consolidation works in full report generation flow:
- Overall maturity description: 40 chars (✓ ≤60 chars)
- Organizational Culture summary: 108 chars (✓ ≤150 chars)

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **No caching** - Each consolidation calls LLM
- **Latency:** ~200-500ms per consolidation
- **Cost:** ~$0.001-0.005 per organization report (5-6 consolidations)

### Future Optimization (if needed)
If performance becomes an issue, consider:

1. **Caching Consolidations**
   ```python
   @lru_cache(maxsize=100)
   def _consolidate_cached(self, text_hash: str, max_chars: int):
       return self.consolidate_text(text, max_chars)
   ```

2. **Batch Consolidation**
   - Consolidate all summaries in one API call
   - More efficient for multiple dimensions

3. **Database Storage**
   - Store consolidated versions with reports
   - Regenerate only when source changes

## Visual Impact

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run unit tests
source venv/bin/activate
python test_consolidation.py

# Run integration tests
python test_report_consolidation.py

# View in browser
python app.py
# Visit: http://localhost:8080
# Navigate to any organization report
```

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- `openai` package (OpenRouter client)
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable (set in `.env.local`)

**Model Used:**
- `anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku`
- Cost: $1/1M input tokens, $5/1M output tokens
- Estimated cost per report: $0.001-0.005

## Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation:**
- If `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` missing → No consolidation, shows original text
- If LLM API fails → Falls back to truncation with ellipsis
- If consolidation times out → Returns original text
- All errors logged but don't break report generation

## Maintenance Notes

**If summaries still too long:**
1. Adjust `max_chars` parameter (currently 120 for dimensions, 55 for overall)
2. Modify prompt to be more aggressive about brevity
3. Increase `temperature` slightly for more varied consolidations

**If summaries too short/losing meaning:**
1. Increase `max_chars` parameter
2. Add "preserve specific details" to prompt
3. Review which phrases are being removed

**If performance becomes an issue:**
1. Add caching (see Performance Considerations above)
2. Batch consolidations in single API call
3. Store consolidated versions in database

## Example Before/After in Production

Based on live data from test organization:

**Organizational Culture (Before):**
"The organization demonstrates a mixed technological culture with pockets of innovation and enthusiasm, but suffers from inconsistent technology training, uneven adoption, and limited strategic investment in technological infrastructure. Leadership appears supportive of change, but systematic approaches to technology integration are lacking." (342 chars)

**Organizational Culture (After):**
"Innovation culture strong, but struggles to effectively implement and strategically deploy new technologies." (108 chars)

**Key Information Preserved:**
- Innovation/enthusiasm present ✓
- Implementation challenges ✓
- Strategic deployment issues ✓

**Removed:**
- Redundant phrases ("mixed technological culture", "pockets of")
- Overly detailed explanations
- Verbose connectors
