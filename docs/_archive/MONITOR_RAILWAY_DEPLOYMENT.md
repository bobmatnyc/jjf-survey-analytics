## 🔧 Alternative: Link Project Locally

If you want to monitor via CLI, link the project:

### Install Railway CLI (if needed)
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Login to Railway
```bash
railway login
```

### Link to Your Project
```bash
# In your project directory
cd /Users/masa/Clients/JimJoseph/jjf-survey-analytics

# Link to Railway project
railway link

# Select your project from the list
```

### Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Check status
railway status

# View logs in real-time
railway logs --follow

# View recent logs
railway logs

# Check environment variables
railway variables

# Open project in browser
railway open
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Once deployment completes, verify:

### 1. Health Check Endpoint
```bash
# Replace with your actual Railway URL
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health/status

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T...",
  "components": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "spreadsheets": 6,
      "total_rows": 55
    },
    "survey_database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "questions": 240,
      "tables": ["surveys", "survey_questions", "survey_responses", ...]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Main Dashboard
```bash
# Open in browser
open https://your-app.railway.app

# Or check with curl
curl -I https://your-app.railway.app
# Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Build Fails

**Check:**
- Build logs in Railway Dashboard
- requirements.txt syntax
- Python version in runtime.txt

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify requirements.txt locally
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check for syntax errors
cat requirements.txt

# Verify runtime.txt
cat runtime.txt
```

### Issue: Deployment Succeeds but App Won't Start

**Check:**
- Application logs in Railway Dashboard
- Environment variables are set
- PORT is not hardcoded

**Fix:**
- Review application logs for errors
- Verify environment variables in Railway
- Check Procfile command

### Issue: Health Check Fails

**Check:**
- Health endpoint path in railway.toml
- Application is actually running
- Port is correct

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test health endpoint manually
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health/status

# Check railway.toml
cat railway.toml | grep healthcheckPath
```

### Issue: Dashboard Shows No Data

**Solution:**
```bash
# Initialize data via Railway CLI
railway run python improved_extractor.py
railway run python survey_normalizer.py --auto

# Or via Railway Shell
railway shell
python improved_extractor.py
python survey_normalizer.py --auto
exit
```
