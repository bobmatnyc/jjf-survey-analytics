## üöÄ Next Steps to Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

You need to authenticate and push the code:

```bash
# Option A: If you have SSH set up
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:bobmatnyc/jjf-survey-analytics.git
git push origin master

# Option B: Use GitHub CLI
gh auth login
git push origin master

# Option C: Use Personal Access Token
# 1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
# 2. Generate new token with 'repo' scope
# 3. Use token as password when prompted
git push origin master
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (If Railway is already connected)

If Railway is already connected to your GitHub repo:
1. Railway will automatically detect the push
2. It will start building and deploying
3. Monitor at: https://railway.app/dashboard

#### Option B: Manual Deployment via Railway Dashboard

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://railway.app
   - Login to your account

2. **Create or Select Project**
   - If new: Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - If existing: Select your project

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```
   REQUIRE_AUTH=false
   SECRET_KEY=<generate-random-key>
   PORT=8080
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Railway will auto-build from your GitHub repo
   - Monitor build logs
   - Wait for deployment to complete

#### Option C: Deploy via Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to project (if not already linked)
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once deployed, verify these endpoints:

1. **Health Check**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.railway.app/health/status
   ```
   Expected: `{"status": "healthy", ...}`

2. **Main Dashboard**
   ```bash
   open https://your-app.railway.app
   ```
   Expected: Dashboard loads with summary view

3. **Check Features**
   - Recent Activity Summary (grouped by spreadsheet)
   - Organization counts
   - Latest Individual Responses (no empty rows)
   - All navigation links work

### Step 4: Initialize Data (First Deployment Only)

After successful deployment:

```bash
# Via Railway CLI
railway run python improved_extractor.py
railway run python survey_normalizer.py --auto

# Or via Railway Shell
railway shell
python improved_extractor.py
python survey_normalizer.py --auto
exit
```

## üìä What's Deployed

### New Features
1. **Empty Row Validation**
   - Skips rows with all empty values
   - Filters out question definition rows
   - Only shows actual response data

2. **Summary View**
   - Groups updates by spreadsheet
   - Shows response count per sheet
   - Displays organization count
   - Lists all participating organizations
   - Shows user count

3. **Enhanced Dashboard**
   - Two-tier view: Summary + Details
   - Organization badges
   - Clean metrics display
   - Direct Google Sheets links

### Documentation Added
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md` - Step-by-step Railway guide
- `EMPTY_ROW_VALIDATION.md` - Validation feature docs
- `DASHBOARD_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Dashboard changes
- `DATA_SYNC_FIXES.md` - Data sync fixes
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Project overview
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick command reference
- `AUTH_DISABLED_FOR_LOCAL.md` - Auth configuration
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Current deployment status

## üîç Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns healthy status
- [ ] Dashboard loads without authentication
- [ ] Summary view shows spreadsheet groups
- [ ] Organization counts are correct
- [ ] Latest updates show no empty rows
- [ ] All spreadsheet links work
- [ ] Navigation between pages works
- [ ] Auto-sync dashboard accessible
- [ ] No errors in Railway logs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
1. Check Railway build logs
2. Verify `requirements.txt` is complete
3. Check `Procfile` syntax
4. Ensure `runtime.txt` has correct Python version

### If App Won't Start
1. Check Railway application logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check health endpoint: `/health/status`
4. Review Procfile command

### If Dashboard is Empty
1. Run data initialization:
   ```bash
   railway run python improved_extractor.py
   railway run python survey_normalizer.py --auto
   ```
2. Check if databases were created
3. Verify data extraction succeeded

## üìù Environment Variables for Railway

**Required:**
```bash
REQUIRE_AUTH=false  # For testing; set to 'true' for production
SECRET_KEY=<generate-with-secrets.token_hex(32)>
```

**Optional (with defaults):**
```bash
PORT=8080
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
AUTO_SYNC_INTERVAL=300
```

**For Production (Recommended):**
```bash
REQUIRE_AUTH=true
APP_PASSWORD=<strong-unique-password>
SECRET_KEY=<random-secret-key>
```
