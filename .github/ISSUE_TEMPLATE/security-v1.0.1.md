### Testing & Verification
- [ ] Run security scan verification
- [ ] Test all database operations work correctly

- [ ] Confirm security headers in responses
- [ ] Test session expiration
- [ ] Full end-to-end testing

### Documentation

## Resources

See **SECURITY_DEBT.md** for:
- Detailed implementation requirements
- Code examples for each fix
- Effort estimates
- Testing checklist

## Timeline

**Target:** v1.0.1 release within 7 days of v1.0.0

## Mitigation in Place

Until v1.0.1 is released:
- Railway environment variables verified (SECRET_KEY, APP_PASSWORD)
- Database access limited to Railway network
- Monitoring enabled for suspicious activity

## Success Criteria

- Zero critical/high severity issues in security scan
- All existing functionality works correctly
- Application properly validates required environment variables
- Security headers present in all HTTP responses
